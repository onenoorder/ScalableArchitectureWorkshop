# Scalable Architecture Workshop: Self-Driving Car Playground

This project is a hands-on workshop playground for exploring scalable software architecture and design patterns using a self-driving car simulation. It features a modular .NET 8 Avalonia UI application, pluggable routing engines, and extensible components to demonstrate real-world architectural decisions.

## Running the Application

1. Install the [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
2. Restore dependencies:
     ```bash
     dotnet restore
     ```
3. Run the Avalonia UI application:
     ```bash
     dotnet run --project SelfDrivingCar.Application
     ```
